The IOS Calendar extension provides the ability to write events to the IOS Calendar.

To use it, download calendar.zip and unpack it in your extensions folder

To use, call createEvent().

The following creates an event at 13:45 on 1st January 2011, with a reminder 15 minutes before it begins.

#include "calendar.h"
createEvent("this is a test event", "2011-01-01 13:45:00", "2011-01-01 14:45:00", "this is the location", 15);
